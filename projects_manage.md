# Adding collaborators to a project
{: #managing_projects}

After you create a project, you can add collaborators to the project to work with the assets in the project.{: #shortdesc}

When you add a collaborator to a project, you specify the actions that the user can do by assigning a role.

These roles provide permissions for projects:

- Viewer: View the project

- Editor: Control project assets

- Admin: Control project assets, collaborators, and settings

To add collaborators to your project:

1. Go to **Navigation Menu > View all projects** and select your project. 

2. From your project, click the **Access Control** page on the **Manage** tab.

3. Click **Add collaborators** then select **Add users**, **Add service IDs**, or **Add user groups**.

   - Users: Enter email addresses into the **Find users** field. 

   - Service IDs: In the **Find service IDs** field, search for the service name or description and select the one you want.

   - User groups: In the **Find groups** field, search for user groups and select the one you want.

4. Choose the role for the collaborators and click **Add**:

5. Select the access level and click **Add**.

When collaborators start using the shared project, they might be prompted to enter their personal credentials to the data source connection when they start a conversation or work with metrics in the semantic data model.

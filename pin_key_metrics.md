# Pinning metrics to Key metrics
{: #pin_metric}

As an Analytics consumer, you can access metrics that you have permissions to view from the **Metrics catalog**, without having to access the full project. {: #shortdesc} 

You can view details of the metrics, related visualizations, and pin metrics from the **Metrics catalog** to your **Key metrics** panel. Pinning a metric to **Key metrics** allows you to easily monitor changes in the data. 

To pin a metric to **Key metrics**:

1. In the **Metrics catalog**, select the metric you want to pin. 

2. Select the visualization that you want to monitor in the **Key metrics** panel and click **Pin to Key metrics**.

Data analysts can also pin metrics to their own **Key metrics** panel in the same manner.
{: note}

You can remove a metric from **Key metrics** by clicking **Unpin from Key metrics** for the selected visualization in the **Metrics catalog**.

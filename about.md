### Cloud Service Solutions platform
{: #service_platform}

{{site.data.keyword.wxbia_full_notm}} uses the cloud service platform, which lets you connect to your data, govern it, find it, and use it for analysis.

 The platform provides the following core functionality: 

- Security, compliance, and isolation
- Compute resources for running workloads
- Global search for assets across the platform
- The platform assets catalog for sharing connections across the platform
- Role-based user management within workspaces
- View compute usage from the Administration menu

For more information about the service platform and its capabilities, see:

- [Overview of IBM Software Hub](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.2.x?topic=overview) 

- [Documentation for Cloud Pak for Data as a Service](https://dataplatform.cloud.ibm.com/docs/content/wsj/getting-started/welcome-main.html?context=wxbi&audience=wdp){: external} 

{{site.data.keyword.wxbia_full_notm}} also uses IBM watsonx.data intelligence, a core service on platform, for metadata import and metadata enrichment. IBM watsonx.data intelligence provides ready-to-use vocabularies that facilitate quick deployment of data governance and analytics frameworks and uses generative AI to augment technical metadata with additional context, labels, and description.

### Service platform features
{: #service_platform_features}

You can access the following platform and IBM watsonx.data intelligence features from the **Navigation Menu** in {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}}. 

#### Projects
{: #projects_service}

Core services on the platform are organized as a set of collaborative workspaces, called **Projects**, where you can work with your team or organization. 

Each project has a set of members with roles that provide permissions to perform actions. 

Users work with assets, which are the items in the project that contain metadata about data or data analysis.

In {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}}, to add the data that you want to ask questions about, you first need to create a project. 

You can then create metrics. Watsonx BI uses metrics and enriched metadata to answer your questions. 

#### Catalogs
{: #catalogs_metric}

The **Metrics catalog** is a centralized repository of published metrics, their metric definition details, and related visualizations. It provides a single source of truth for published metrics used across the organization.

Data analysts can publish metrics to the **Metrics catalog** and assign them to Analytics consumers.

As an Analytics consumer, you can browse the **Metrics catalog** to view the metrics that are available to you. Click on a metric to view metric details and related visualizations. You can ask a question about a specific metric directly from the **Metrics catalog**.

You can also add metrics to your **Key metrics** panel from the **Metrics catalog** to monitor changes in your data.

#### Semantic layer and governance
{: #governance_features}

{{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short_cap}} comes with a predefined governance framework to help you get started on your data analysis journey. This predefined governance framework applies business meaning to your data through governance artifacts. The governance framework along with metadata enrichment, which automatically analyzes and enhances technical metadata with more context, labels or descriptions, creates the semantic layer that helps activate information for AI. 

You can customize the existing governance framework in {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}} to meet your business context needs by implementing the following governance artifacts.

- **Categories** - Use [categories](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-categories) to organize governance artifacts in a hierarchical structure similar to folders. You can use category roles to define ownership of artifacts, control their authoring, and restrict their visibility.  

- **Business terms** - Use [business terms](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-business_terms) to implement a common enterprise vocabulary to describe the meaning of data. You create business terms to ensure clarity and compatibility among departments, projects, or products. Business terms are the core of your governance framework and typically form the bulk of your governance artifacts. 

- **Data classes** - [Data classes](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-data_classes) classify data based on the structure, format, and range of values of the data. You can create relationships with business terms to link data format with business meaning. 

- **Classifications** - [Classifications](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-classifications) describe specific characteristics of the meaning of data. Predefined classifications describe the sensitivity of the data. You can create classifications to describe other characteristics of data or other governance items. 

- **Reference data sets** - [Reference data sets](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-reference_data) define standard values for specific types of data to classify data and measure consistency.They act as lookup tables that map codes and values. You can include a reference data set in the definition of a data class as part of the data matching criteria.

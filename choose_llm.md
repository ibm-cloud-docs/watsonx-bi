# Choosing the large language model (LLM) 
{: #choose_llm}

At the time of setting up {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_full}}, Administrators can choose the large language model (LLM) that will be used in {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}} conversations for users in their organization. {: #shortdesc}

Administrators can also change the LLM at any time from the **Configuration and settings** page. 

## Available LLMs
{: #available_llms}

As an Administrator, you can choose from the following LLMs:

| LLM | Available in watsonx BI| 
|-------|---------|
|[OpenAI gpt-oss-120b](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/watsonx/saas?topic=models-third-party-foundation#gpt-oss){: external} and IBM Granite-3-8b-instruct| As a Service, Software Hub 5.2.2 and later versions|
|[Meta Llama 4](https://www.llama.com/docs/model-cards-and-prompt-formats/llama4/){: external} and IBM Granite-3-8b-instruct | As a Service|
|[IBM Granite-3-8b-instruct](https://www.ibm.com/docs/watsonx/w-and-w/2.2.0?topic=models-granite-30-8b-instruct-model-card){: external} | As a Service, Software Hub 5.2.0 and later versions |

Watsonx BI on Software Hub 5.2.1 and previous versions use IBM Granite-3-8b-instruct to respond to your questions. 
{: note}

## How model selection affects conversations
{: #model_selection}

While watsonx BI utilizes large language models for various tasks, this feature specifically controls which LLMs are used for SQL generation. You can choose the LLM based on your specific requirements for SQL generation performance and accuracy.

* **IBM Granite-3-8b-instruct**

  When you select only the Granite model, it is used for all language model tasks, including SQL generation. 
  
  Choose Granite-3-8b-instruct to work with simple BI queries, such as basic data retrieval and summarization.

* **OpenAI gpt-oss-120b and IBM Granite-3-8b-instruct**

  When you select the gpt-oss-120b and Granite combination, gpt-oss-120b is used specifically for SQL generation tasks, while Granite continues to be used for all other language model tasks.

  Choose this combination for advanced, configurable reasoning in complex BI queries.

* **Meta Llama 4 and IBM Granite-3-8b-instruct**

  When you select Meta Llama 4 and Granite, Meta Llama 4 is used specifically for SQL generation tasks, while Granite continues to be used for all other language model tasks.

  Choose Meta Llama 4 and Granite for complex, multi-step BI queries. 




## Changing the large language model
{: #change_llm}

Administrators change the LLM from **Navigation menu > Configuration and settings**. 

When you change the LLM, the change applies at the account level and to new conversations or queries. This means that the change applies to everyone that is a part of the account that has access to {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}}.

Users can see the updated LLM name in the AI icon in **Conversations**. Additionally, users can see the LLM being used in the query generation step under **Steps taken by AI** when they ask their next question or start a new conversation.

# Using the Metrics catalog
{: #metrics_catalog}

The **Metrics catalog** is a centralized repository of published metrics, their metric definition details, and related visualizations. It provides a single source of truth for published metrics used across the organization. {: #shortdesc}

By publishing metrics to the **Metrics catalog**, Data analysts can manage and govern access of metrics without having to share the project in which the metrics were created.

Analytics consumers can quickly see the metrics and visualizations that they have access to in the **Metrics catalog**. Analytics consumers can browse for metrics that interest them and pin them to their **Key metrics** or ask questions for a specific metric directly from the **Metrics catalog**.

## Pinning and unpinning metrics
{: #pin}

As an Analytics consumer, you can access metrics that you have permissions to view from the **Metrics catalog**. 

You can view metric details, related visualizations, and pin metrics from the **Metrics catalog** to your **Key metrics** panel. Pinning a metric to **Key metrics** allows you to easily monitor changes in the data. 

Data analysts can also pin metrics to their own **Key metrics** panel in the same manner.
{: note}

To pin a metric to **Key metrics**:

1. In the **Metrics catalog**, select the metric you want to pin. 

2. Select the visualization that you want to monitor in the **Key metrics** panel and click **Pin to Key metrics**.

You can remove a metric that you pinned from **Key metrics**. 

1. In the Metrics catalgo, go to the visualization that you want remove from **Key metrics**.

2.  Click **Unpin from Key metrics**.

## Assigning metrics to users
{: #assign}

Data analysts can assign metrics to users. These metrics display under the user's **Key metrics** in **Conversations**.

1. In the **Metrics catalog**, select the metric you want to assign.

2. Select the visualization that will display in the **Key metrics** panel and click **Assign to members**.

3. Select the users that you want to assign the metric to and click **Save**. 

  To add new users and groups, click **Add members**.
  {: note}

## Asking questions from Metrics catalog
{: #ask_metrics_catalog}

All users can ask questions against a specific metric directly from the **Metrics catalog**. 

1. Select the metric that you want to ask about.

2. Click **Ask a question**. 

The **Conversations** page opens with a new conversation. You'll notice that the welcome message and the dropdown next to the input box display the name of the metric that you had selected. This means that any question that you now ask about will be scoped to the selected metric.

# Governance framework
{: #governance}

IBM watonx BI comes with a predefined governance framework that helps apply business meaning to your data through governance artifacts: {: #shortdesc}

- Prebuilt business terms, data classes, classifications, and reference data sets

- Industry-specific Knowledge Accelerator

However, you can also create your own governance framework in watsonx BI to establish your business concepts by implementing governance artifacts in collaborative workspaces called [categories](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-categories). Much like folders, categories organize governance artifacts in a hierarchical structure. 

During [metadata enrichment](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-enrich), watsonx BI uses IBM watsonx.data intelligence's capability to match technical metadata with predefined business concepts. Technical metadata is augmented with more descriptive and meaningful names, drawing from the predefined and your domain-specific glossary concepts.

You can add the following governance artifacts in watsonx BI: 

- [Business terms](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-business_terms)

  Business terms implement a common enterprise vocabulary to describe the meaning of data.

- [Classifications](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-classifications)

  Classifications describe specific characteristics of data. 

- [Data classes](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-data_classes)

  Data classes classify data based on the structure, format, and range of values of the data.

- [Reference data](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-reference_data)

  Reference data sets define standard values for specific types of data to classify data and measure consistency.

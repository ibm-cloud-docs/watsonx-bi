# Defining business logic with the semantic layer and governance
{: #governance}

{{site.data.keyword.wxbia_full_notm}} comes with a predefined governance framework that helps apply business meaning to your data through governance artifacts. This framework along with the metadata enrichment, which automatically analyzes and enhances technical metadata with more context, labels or descriptions, creates the **semantic layer** that helps activate information for AI. {: #shortdesc}

[Metadata enrichment](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-enrich) takes place when you upload files or create metrics in a project. During metadata enrichment, {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}} uses IBM watsonx.data intelligence's capability to match technical metadata with predefined business concepts. Technical metadata is augmented with more descriptive and meaningful names, drawing from the predefined and your domain-specific business concepts.
{: note}

{{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short_cap}} includes:

- Predefined business terms, data classes, classifications, and reference data sets

- Industry-specific Knowledge Accelerator

You can build a more robust semantic layer by establishing your own business concepts in watsonx BI by implementing governance artifacts in [categories](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-categories). Much like folders, categories organize governance artifacts in a hierarchical structure. 

You can add the following governance artifacts in {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}}: 

- [Business terms](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-business_terms)

  Business terms implement a common enterprise vocabulary to describe the meaning of data.

- [Classifications](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-classifications)

  Classifications describe specific characteristics of data. 

- [Data classes](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-data_classes)

  Data classes classify data based on the structure, format, and range of values of the data.

- [Reference data](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-reference_data)

  Reference data sets define standard values for specific types of data to classify data and measure consistency.

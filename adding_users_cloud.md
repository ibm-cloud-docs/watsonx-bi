# Adding users to the Cloud account 
{: #add_users_account}

As a Cloud account owner or Administrator, you can add the people in your organization who need access to the watsonx BI to the IBM Cloud account and then assign them the appropriate  roles for their tasks. {: #shortdesc}

Invite users by sending an invitation from **Administration > Configurations and settings > Access (IAM)** in watsonx BI. You can also invite users from the IBM Cloud account by selecting **Manage > IAM > Users**. 

The new users receive an email invitation to join the account. They must accept the invitation to be added to the account. 

After the user accepts the invitation, you can assign them roles (or access groups) to provide the necessary permissions to use watsonx BI.

There are two types of roles that are required for watsonx BI: 

- Collaborator roles 

- IAM roles

The collaborator roles determine what the user can do in watsonx BI. You can set these roles from the **Administration > Configurations and settings > Manage BI community** page in watsonx BI.  

The IAM roles provide Service and Platform level assignments, which determine access to service and platform resources and are set in the IBM Cloud account from **Manage > Access (IAM) > Users**.

## Next step
{: #next}

The next step is to add the users to the watsonx BI community and assign them roles to work in watsonx BI. For more information, see [Roles and permissions in watsonx BI](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-roles).

# Adding users to the Cloud account 
{: #add_users_account}

As a Cloud account owner or Administrator, you can add the people in your organization who need access to  {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_full}} to the IBM Cloud account and then assign them the appropriate roles for their tasks. {: #shortdesc}

Invite users by sending an invitation from **Administration > Configurations and settings > Access (IAM)** in {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}}. You can also invite users from the IBM Cloud account by selecting **Manage > IAM > Users**. 

The new users receive an email invitation to join the account. They must accept the invitation to be added to the account. 

After the users accept the invitation, you can assign them roles (or access groups) to provide the necessary permissions to use {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}}.

There are two types of roles that are required for {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}}: 

- Collaborator roles 

- IAM roles

The collaborator roles determine what the user can do in {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}}. You can set these roles from the **Administration > Configurations and settings > Manage BI community** page in {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}}.  

The IAM roles provide Service and Platform level assignments, which determine access to service and platform resources and are set in the IBM Cloud account from **Manage > Access (IAM) > Users**.

## Next step
{: #next}

The next step is to add the users to the {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}} community and assign them roles to work in {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}}. 

For more information, see [Roles and permissions in {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}}](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-roles).

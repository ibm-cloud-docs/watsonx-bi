# Creating a project
{: #projects_wxbi}

A project is a collaborative workspace where you work with data and other assets to accomplish a particular goal, such as creating metrics. {: #shortdesc}

Any data you want to work with and want to ask about, first needs to be added to a project through a connection or by uploading data files. You can see a list of projects you have access to under **Navigation menu > Projects > View all projects**. 

You can choose an existing project to work in or create a new project from the **Data and Metrics** tab. 

To create a project:

1. On the **Data and Metrics** tab, click **Create project**, if you're creating a project for the very first time. Otherwise, click the '+' button next to the project list. 

2. Enter a name for your project. 

The new project is automatically configured for {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}}. 

You can manage the project from **Navigation Menu > Projects > View all projects**. 

If your organization has given you access to sample data and you choose to install it, a project for the sample data is automatically created.

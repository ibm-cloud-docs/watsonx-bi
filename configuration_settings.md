# Managing configuration and settings for administrative users
{: #config_settings}

[Cloud account owners]{: tag-blue} [Account administrators]{: tag-blue}

Administrative users can access **Configuration and settings** from **Navigation Menu > Administration** and from the left-hand side panel in {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_full_notm}} to manage access to the {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}} instance through Manage BI community, manage storage, and set up sample data from here. Depending on your role and permissions, you might be able to make other configuration changes. {: #shortdesc}


## Manage BI community
{: #manage_bi_comm}

Use **Manage BI community** to add users or user groups that have been invited to your {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}} account. You can also manage users here by removing them or my modifying their roles. 

## Sample data 
{: #sample_config}

You can explore {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}}'s features with a prebuilt sample. Each sample is optimized for AI and comes with prebuilt metrics that you can use right away to ask questions in **Conversations**. 

Samples are not supported in {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}} on IBM Software Hub. 
{: note}

## Model settings
{: #model_settings_tab}

During the initial setup of {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}}, administrative users select the large language model (LLM) that will be used in conversations for all users in the account. 

They can also change the LLM from the **Model settings** tab under **Configuration and settings**. When the LLM selection changes, the change applies at the account level and to new conversations or queries. This means that the change applies to everyone that is a part of the account that has access to {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}}.

The ability to choose the LLM is not available in {{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short}} on IBM Software Hub 5.2.x. Watsonx BI on Software Hub 5.2.x uses [IBM Granite-3-8b-instruct](https://www.ibm.com/docs/watsonx/w-and-w/2.2.0?topic=models-granite-30-8b-instruct-model-card){: external} to respond to questions.

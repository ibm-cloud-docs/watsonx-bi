# IBM Cloud Object Storage 
{: #cos}

IBM CloudÂ® Object Storage is a highly available, durable, and secure platform for storing unstructured data. Object storage is the most efficient way to store PDFs, media files, database backups, disk images, or even large structured datasets. {: #shortdesc}

The files that are uploaded into IBM Cloud Object Storage are called **objects**. They are organized into **buckets** that serve as containers for objects, and which can be configured independently from one another in terms of locations, resiliency, billing rates, security, and object lifecycle. 

{{site.data.keyword.wxbia_full}} requires an instance of IBM Cloud Object Storage for creating your first project and storing: 

- Projects

- Sampled data

- Metrics

- Uploaded data

- Metrics catalog

- Conversations 

As the IBM Cloud account owner or Administrator, you provision an instance of Cloud Object Storage.

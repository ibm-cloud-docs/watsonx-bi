# Types of visualizations
{: #visualizations}

{{site.data.keyword.wxbia_full_notm}} generates a visualization or chart when you ask for one or when a visual of your data, along with a text-based response, might be better suited to help you quickly see relationships, trends, and comparisons in the data. {: #shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.wxbia_short_cap}} analyzes your data and chooses the best visualization type to show your data. However, if other visualizations are available for your data, the **Options** icon in the visualization is enabled. Click **Options** to change the visualization to a different chart type. 

## Common types of visualizations
{: #chart_types}

Here are some of the visualization types that you might see under **Options**. Each visualization has its own strengths and displays data differently. 

### Area 
{: #chart_area}

An area chart emphasizes the magnitude of change over time.

Area charts are like line charts, but the areas below the lines are filled with colors or patterns. An area chart stacks the results for each column or item and the total of all results is easily seen.

For example, an area visualization is excellent for looking at revenue over time across several products.

### Bar
{: #chart_bar}

A bar visualization compares values by one or more columns, such as sales for products or sales for products each month.

Bar visualizations use horizontal data markers that are arranged in groups to compare individual values and can show change over a specific time period or compare and contrast two or more columns in a time period or over time. 

### Box plot
{: #chart_box}

Box plot visualizations are used to identify outliers and compare distributions.

A box plot can show the median, quartiles, outlier, and extreme values for a variable. The inter-quartile range is the difference between the 75th and 25th percentiles and corresponds to the length of the box. The middle line is the 50th percentile.

Above and under each box, whiskers give additional information about the spread of the data.

Far out values are represent by adding "o" signs beyond the whiskers.

The mean score in a box plot is presented by a "+" sign.

### Column
{: #chart_column}

Much like a bar chart, a column visualization compares values by one or more columns such as sales for products each month.

Column visualizations use vertical data markers that are arranged in groups to compare individual values. A column visualization shows change over a specific time period or can compare and contrast two or more columns in a time period or over time.

### Crosstab
{: #chart_crosstab}

A crosstab can show relationships between three or more columns or rows. Crosstabs show data in rows and columns with information summarized at the intersection points.

### Heatmap
{: #chart_heatmap}

Heat map visualizations show the relationship between two variables through color. Most often, dark colors represent high-value data points and light colors represent low-value data points.

### Line
{: #chart_line}

Line visualizations show trends over time.

A line visualization can compare trends and cycles, infer relationships between variables, or show how a single variable is performing over time.

### List
{: #chart_list}

List visualizations create an overview of data in a hierarchical way. You can use a list visualization as a filter widget.

### Packed bubble
{: #chart_packed}

Packed bubble visualizations display data in a cluster of circles.

A packed bubble visualization uses sizable plotted points, also known as bubbles, to show the relationship between two data sets. The size of the bubble corresponds to the value or proportion of data. There is no positional axis and the bubbles are arranged in a random cluster.

Packed bubble visualizations help convey data that contains many groups and categories. Most often, the bubbles are arranged in a hierarchical order, with larger bubbles placed at the center and smaller bubbles place along the outside.

### Pie
{: #chart_pie}

Pie visualizations highlight proportions. Each slice shows the relative relationship of each part to the whole. The larger the size of a slice, the higher the percentage of the whole it represents. Pie charts are suitable to use with both nominal and categorical data sets.

### Point
{: #chart_point}

A point visualization show trends over time and is like a line chart without the connecting lines.

Point visualizations can compare trends and cycles, infer relationships between variables, or show how a single variable is performing over time.

Data values are plotted vertically.

### Radar
{: #chart_radar}

Radar visualizations are used to compare multiple quantitative variables. The radar visualization shows which variables have similar or outlier values.

Radar visualizations also show which variables score high or low in a data set, which is useful to display performance. For example, you can use a radar visualization to compare competitor profiles, such as the number of employees, revenue, profit, current stock price, and customer satisfaction.

### Spiral
{: #chart_spiral}

A spiral visualization shows you the key drivers, or predictors, for a given target. The closer the driver is to the center, the stronger that driver is.

### Word cloud
{: #chart_word}

A word cloud visualization displays text-based visualization of a column. The text height represents the scale. The name itself is the different members of the column.

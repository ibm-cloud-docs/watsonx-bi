# Try metrics 
{: #try_metrics}

You can try asking questions about a metric that you generated automatically or built manually to ensure it can answer questions about your data. 

1. On the **Metrics overview** page, click the context menu for a metric. 

2. Click **Try in conversation**. 

A conversation opens and you can test the metric against your questions. 

The conversation is scoped to the selected metric only. 
{: note}

At any time, you can go back to the **Advanced mode** to adjust its metric definition, if necessary. 

You need to export the updated metric definition for the changes to apply to the metric.

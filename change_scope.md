# Changing the scope of the conversation
{: #scope}

You can change the scope of a conversation by selecting the data you want to ask about from the dropdown in the input box and entering your question. {: #shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.wxbia_full_notm}} uses the selected scope to answer your questions and provide insights. This feature allows you to narrow down the focus of the conversation to selective data sources. 

You can set the scope of a conversation to:

- **All data**  

  Includes data assets, including metrics and uploaded files, in all of the projects that you have access to.

- **Mandatory metrics** 

  These are the metrics that were created for you by your organization and which appear in the **Key metrics** panel.

- **A specific project** 

  You can choose from projects that you created or those that you have access to.



- **A metric from the Metrics catalog** 

  When you choose to ask a question against a single metric from the **Metrics catalog**, you're automatically taken to **Conversations** with the scope set to the metric you selected.





When you change the scope and ask your question, a message displays in the conversation canvas to confirm the change in the scope. The selected scope remains until you change it again.

Scope change only applies to new questions that you ask. The scope of a previous or a saved conversation doesn't change when you change the scope in the input box.

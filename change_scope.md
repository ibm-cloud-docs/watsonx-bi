# Changing the scope of the conversation
{: #scope}

You can change the scope of a conversation by selecting the data you want to ask about from the dropdown in the input box and entering your question. {: #shortdesc}

IBM watsonx BI uses the selected scope to answer your questions and provide insights. This feature allows you to narrow down the focus of the conversation to selective data sources. 

You can set the scope of a conversation to:

- **All data**  

  Includes data assets, including metrics and uploaded files, in all of the projects that you have access to.

- **Mandatory metrics** 

  These are the metrics that were created for you by your organization and which appear in the **Key metrics** panel.

- **A specific project** 

  You can choose from projects that you created or those that you have access to.

- **An uploaded file** - You can choose a file that you've uploaded and which has gone through metadata enrichment. 

- **A metric from the Metrics catalog** 

  When you choose to ask a question against a single metric from the **Metrics catalog**, you're automatically taken to **Conversations** with the scope set to the metric you selected.

- **Sample data** - If you installed sample data at the time of setup, you can ask set the scope of the conversation to just the sample data set. You can install sample data at any time from **Configuration and settings**. 

The upload file and sample data features are available only in watsonx BI as a Service.
{: important}

When you change the scope and ask your question, a message displays in the conversation canvas to confirm the change in the scope. The selected scope remains until you change it again.

Scope change only applies to new questions that you ask. The scope of a previous or a saved conversation doesn't change when you change the scope in the input box.

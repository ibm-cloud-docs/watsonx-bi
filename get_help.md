# Getting help and support 
{: #help-and-support}

If you experience an issue or have questions when using watsonx BI, you can use the following resources before you open a support case. {: #shortdesc}

* Review the [FAQs](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-my-service-faqs) in the product documentation.

* [Software]{: tag-red} Review the [Troubleshooting guide](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/software-hub/5.2.x?topic=troubleshooting) for IBM Software Hub.

* [Cloud]{: tag-blue} Check the status of the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} platform and resources by going to the [Status page](https://cloud.ibm.com/status){: external}.

* [Cloud]{: tag-blue} Review [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/ibm-cloud){: external} to see whether other users experienced the same problem. When you ask a question, tag the question with `ibm-cloud` and `service-Name` so that the {{site.data.keyword.Bluemix_notm}} development teams see the question. 

If you still can't resolve the problem, you can open a support case if your service plan covers it:

- [IBM Support (Software)](https://www.ibm.com/mysupport/s/?language=en_US) 

- [IBM Cloud Support Center](https://cloud.ibm.com/unifiedsupport/supportcenter)

If you're opening a support case for an error in watsonx BI, remember to include the trace ID or error ID in the details.

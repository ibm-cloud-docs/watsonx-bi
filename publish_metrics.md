# Publish metrics and visualizations (Data analysts only)
{: #publish_metrics}

As a Data analyst, you can publish metrics to the **Metrics catalog** and specify access permissions. Analytics consumers  can access metrics, which they have permissions to view without having to access the full project. {: #shortdesc}

1. From the **Data and Metrics** tab, open the semantic model with the metrics that you want to publish.

2. On the **Metrics overview** page, click **Publish metrics**.

3. Select the metrics and associated visualizations that you want to publish. 

4. Specify who can access the published metrics and add users. 

5. Click **Publish**.

You can view the published metrics in the **Metrics catalog**. 

From the **Metrics catalog**, you can now assign metrics to an Analytics consumer. Assigned metrics appear in the Analytics consumer's **Key metrics** panel where they can monitor changes in the data. For more information, see [Assigning metrics to users](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-metrics_catalog#assign){: external}.

Analytics consumers can also view details of the metrics they have access to and pin them from the **Metrics catalog** to their **Key metrics** panel. For more information, see [Pinning and unpinning metrics](/docs/watsonx-bi?topic=watsonx-bi-metrics_catalog#pin){: external}.

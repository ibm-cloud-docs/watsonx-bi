IBM watsonx BI is supported in English only. {: #shortdesc}

For the best experience with the watsonx BI product and documentation, use the supported browsers. Otherwise, you might experience limits to functionality.

## Web browsers

If you use Firefox on MacOS, your Mac might interpret horizontal scrolling within the UI as an attempt to swipe between pages. If you do not want this behavior or if the browser crashes after the service prompts you to stay on the page, go to **Launchpad > System Settings > Trackpad** and change the **Swipe between pages** gesture in the **More Gestures** section.
